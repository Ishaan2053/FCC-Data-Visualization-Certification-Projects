This GitHub repository contains a collection of projects I completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp 'Data Visualization' certification curriculum. The data visualization projects are made using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and D3.js.

Please use this repository as a resource for inspiration and guidance, but do NOT plagiarize the code. It is important to understand the concepts and write your own code to truly learn and improve your skills. Additionally, plagiarism is a violation of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) Honor Code and [GitHub's Community Guidelines.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines)

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue or contact me directly.
